"""Adam-12"" (1968) {Extortion (#4.1)}"	 Patrol starts with a call to a robbery at a bar and a car chase but the thieves escape. A call to a dry cleaners concerns the owner being extorted for protection money along with other shop owners who are Jewish survivors of the Holecaust. The dry cleaner wants to press charges but others are fearful of retribution. Two men are captured but two escape. Some searching turns up the car used in the robbery and a lead on the second car they used to escape. This is followed by a return call to the dry cleaners where the owner's panel truck is burning. During patrol they spot the second car used in the escape and a chase ensues resulting in their capture after Malloy comes close to taking a shotgun blast. They close out with another call to the dry cleaners where the owner has been attacked. With a tip from a nearby store owner they track down the two men responsible for the beating and destruction in the store. Malloy and Reed lose the three suspects of an armed bar hold-up in a vehicle pursuit. As they continue their tracking of the suspects, they hope that the information provided by the only eyewitness following them losing the three men - that eyewitness being a little boy, an irate one at that - pans out. Next, they attend to a call of a dry cleaning store that is being shaken down by a bunch of neo-Nazi's. Mr. Fine, the elderly dry cleaner owner/operator, is only one of a half a dozen Jewish business owners in the beach area who are targeted, but Mr. Fine is the only one thus far willing to speak out about what is going on. Mr. Gold, the owner of the caf√© next to the cleaners, and Mrs. Fine, on the other hand, do not want to talk, fearing retribution. Malloy and Reed are able to capture two of the four men in their initial pursuit. However, what the outstanding two suspects may or may not do may ultimately affect whether Mr. Fine continues to talk, and/or what the others, like Mr. Gold and Mrs. Fine, will do to protect themselves. Also down by the beach, a disgruntled but drunk employee of a boatyard decides to do something grand to show his employer how mad he is for not being paid.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

That is followed with a call to a bar where a fight was reported between Apache Indians but the fight has stopped when they arrive. Later they receive a tip that a fight to the death is about to occur between the Apaches because one of them is seeing the other one's 16 year old sister. Adam-12 makes it to their latest call, a bar, just after an explosion happens inside. This explosion is just the latest in a string of such bombings of small businesses in Adam-12's patrol area. The woman who called the police about this issue, Helen Shipley, believes she has information about what happened in this specific circumstance - what sounds to be extortion of small business owners - which would be the first real break in the case if the information pans out. This case has a side story of an impressionable boy whose adult friend gets caught in the crossfire of the dangerous culprit. Next they are called to another bar, where there was a report of a fight. Upon their arrival, nothing is going down, and the mainly native American client√®le as well as the bartender seem to be hiding any problem that may have happened. But Malloy has dealt with two of the customers in the past, and knowing them he just hopes they can discover what's going on before someone really gets hurt or killed. In-between, they attend to a call of a woman who believes someone is trying to break into her house.

Their guest taster is 'Ben Genaille' (qv), an aboriginal chef and cooking instructor who founded one of the few cooking programs in North America focusing on indigenous foods. As an instructor, Chef Ben will critique the meal as he would if prepared by his students. With help from the book, will Anna and Kristina be able to get over the hurdle of not knowing how to work with some of the unusual ingredients (in Kristina's mind, ""spawn"" is not a food but a horror movie)? In addition, they test different fillet knives to fillet whole fish."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

That night, a group of 18-year-olds, two armed with tyre levers, chased two men over the same overpass after something was thrown at their car.

Since losing her son Daniel in February this year to cancer, the Tamworth resident has stepped up her campaign to legalise medicinal cannabis. Widely credited as the driving force behind a raft of state and federal initiatives aimed at legalising the drug, Lucy Haslam is concerned by delays in the political process and is striking out on her own. She has assembled a team which recently applied to the NSW Government for an exemption which will allow them to grow medicinal cannabis for research and development purposes in Tamworth. Her commitment is absolute. She and her husband Lou, a former drug squad officer, have put their business on the market to help achieve their goal. It is a deeply personal crusade. Lucy Haslam's son Daniel was diagnosed at the age of 20 with stage 4 bowel cancer and only found relief from his nausea after ingesting medicinal cannabis. Forced to break the law in order to source the cannabis, Lucy and Daniel went public last year calling on politicians to follow the example of other countries around the world. A face to face meeting between NSW Premier Mike Baird and the Haslams was a turning point in their campaign. ""It was very clear listening to the story I wanted to do something.

Her religious beliefs prevented her from having a casual sexual relationship in order to conceive, so she managed to find a doctor who would perform an IVF procedure. Kerry battled with her own conscience and ethics before taking this step. It was also very hard for her parents to accept, both because of Kerry's illness and their religion; her father is a church minister. As Kerry describes it, in the end love won out over theology and Sean Michael was born nearly a year ago. Not everyone will agree with the choices Kerry has made but they will respect her determination and take pleasure in the love that Sean Michael has brought to her whole family. Sean Michael is a happy healthy baby. He also has Down Syndrome. The story is introduced by Brisbane 7.30 Report's David Margan and his two baby boys, Nicholas and Jake. PLUS: The Go Between: This is the story of Rick Farley and his decision to leave the heady but manipulative world of politics.

He's had enough of all that and now wants to indulge his own passions; his family, land care and Aboriginal issues.

"""Australian Story"" (1996) {Million to One: Part 1 (#12.5)}"	" Australian Story looks inside a health and workplace crisis that's been described as a first in Australia and possibly the world. Arguably it's a situation that could have happened anywhere. But it happened at the national broadcaster and it involves people more used to reporting the news than making the news. The crisis became a major news story just before Christmas when the ABC announced the closure of its Queensland headquarters because of the confirmed high level of breast cancer among women employees, many of them only in their 30s and early 40s. The closure, thought to be on a scale that is unprecedented, followed a report by an independent scientific panel appointed by the ABC's new Managing Director, Mark Scott. The report found that the incidence of breast cancer among women working at the ABC in Brisbane was around six times higher than expected. The chances of this being a statistical fluke were put at ""one in a million''. Mr Scott says, ""breast cancer clusters like this hadn't been found anywhere else in the world.'' He recalls that when he first heard the statistic he had to check that he was hearing correctly. But no on-site cause could be found at the time, although investigations are continuing. Australian Story has the personal stories of the women who say their long campaign against the site has been justified. And the program - comprising two episodes - looks at the medical and scientific mystery that remains and the possible implications for women everywhere."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

There was no pattern, no motive - victims were young and old, male and female. People stopped going out. Husbands came straight home from work. Children were brought into their parent's bedrooms. Nobody ventured out and everything was locked and barred. To this day the time is recalled with fear and loathing. Eventually, after a long-drawn out surveillance operation, Eric Edgar Cooke was arrested following a tip off from an elderly couple who had found his murder weapon. People were shocked to learn that Cooke was a married man with seven children. But no one was more astounded than his own wife, Sally. She recounts the story of Eric telling her to gather the children in the lounge room, to sleep at night, for their own safety. Cooke was subsequently hanged on 26th October, 1964. In the ensuing years, Tony was forced to deal with stigma and alienation. He remembers vividly the day he he decided to ""no longer be a victim,"" . Tony became dux of his primary school and Captain of Belmont High School. He won numerous academic scholarships and has gone on to become one of the trade union movement's leading figures.

She somehow crawled to a roadside and was found many hours later. Her attacker was convicted rapist Darren Osbourne who'd just been released on parole. Osbourne subsequently killed a young English woman before being captured and ultimately committing suicide in jail. Shari survived but the events of that night changed not just her life but the lives of many other people - some of them complete strangers. Her father Ian gave up his panel beating business and has travelled a path that's taken him from would-be vigilante (""I was so angry that I was ready to kill"") to victims' support group founder and eventually a major role as a Corrective Services Commissioner in Queensland where he has been a powerful advocate for progressive measures such as anger management and skills training for prisoners. Ian Davies says it is crucial that the suffering of victims is taken into full account but also acknowledges the disadvantages in the backgrounds of many prisoners. Of Osbourne he says: ""I started to think about what opportunity did he have, what opportunities does any prisoner have. Are we just throwing them in jail without somebody checking to see whether or not that person was ready to be put back into the community?"" Shari thought she had recovered but was plunged into deep depression three years ago by the trauma of reliving her experiences through a book and the publicity that followed.

The series focuses primarily on the lives of seven residents living with Belle Vue; wealthy South Africans Amanda, Monique and Charles, resident beauty therapist Wok, senior citizen Mindi, and the newly arrived Bob and Susan, a down to earth couple from Tasmania. Guiding us along our journey are reporter Simone, and the manager (or attempting to be) of Belle Vue, Henry. Joining them all is a cavalcade of other residents living within the gates. We watch as the residents lives unfold, particularly the tensions which ensue following the attempted integration of Bob and Susan.

Dr. Douglas Filmore, now also graduated in forensic anthropology, acts as intern to observe the Jeffersonian team for an official report on US-Canadian forensic collaboration."	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""California Coastal Trail"" (2015) {Oceanside Transit Center: San Diego County's Transit Hub (#1.7)}"	 The majority of San Diego's coastline may be developed, but it's fortunate enough to also be hugged by a major rail artery. Multiple trains come and go, with some traversing as far as 300 miles north to California's Central Coast. Not only that, the county's coastal cities and agencies have all agreed to build the Coastal Rail Trail, an ambitious bikeway project. Here's what you can grab from this important transit hub: Coastal Rail Trail: when finished, the goal of this 44-mile bikeway is to be a robust mix of bike path and protected bikeway between Oceanside and downtown San Diego generally following the rail corridor (there will be some on-street bike lanes and routes throughout). As of spring 2015, It's nearly half way complete in separated segments. Want to take advantage of what's out there now? The GoBikeSD interactive map can deliver you to plenty of places along the coast with existing bicycle infrastructure. The Coaster: as its name suggests, the Coaster spans most of the San Diego County coastline running over 20 trains on weekdays and a modified schedule on the weekends. It takes about one hour to travel the whole thing, so good thing there are plenty of coastal views to take in for most of the ride. Pacific Surfliner: one of the busiest Amtrak lines in the country, the Surfliner climbs up and down the coast between downtown San Diego and San Luis Obispo, hitting major stations in Anaheim, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara. While it doesn't stop at every station in San Diego County, it can be used for some local commutes. Metrolink: usually associated with the Los Angeles metro region, two of Metrolink's routes dip into San Diego County at Oceanside: the lines from Los Angeles Union Station and the Inland Empire. Sprinter, Breeze, and more: the Oceanside Transit Center also serves as an important hub for inland commuting. The Sprinter is a light rail travels to Escondido while the Breeze bus service offers numerous routes in the north county region.

"""Code Lyoko"" (2003)"	" ""Code Lyoko"" tells the story of a group of students who uncover a parallel universe called Lyoko inside a super-computer that is threatened by a renegade program named XANA that could destroy the world. It's up to four boarding-school students named Jeremy, Yumi, Ulrich, and Odd to help a humanoid being inside Lyoko named Aelita to stop the rogue program XANA and his plans to attack their world. Jeremy, who is in love with Aelita, struggles through season 1 to find a way to ""materialize"" Aelita, so she can become human by exiting the scanners that connect Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi to Lyoko. If Jeremy accomplishes this, he will be able to shut down Lyoko and defeat XANA. We witness Jeremy finally materializes Aelita, and accomplish his dream. The group deactivate Lyoko, but XANA apparently infected Aelita with a virus before she was materialized so that if XANA goes, she does too! In the beginning of season 2, we witness the dawn of new technology. Jeremy programs vehicles into Lyoko for faster travel and makes a better scan program to detect ""activated towers"", so Aelita can live on Earth without having to stay in Lyoko to look out for XANA's attacks on Earth! ALong with that, Jeremy announces that he is working on an antivirus good enough to save Aelita from XANA! Franz Hopper, a brilliant scientist, seems related to Aelita after some research. After discovering the Lyoko gang discovers the truth, he reveals more about Aelita and XANA."	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Her ""western"" themed party menu consists of jalape√±o poppers and cowboy cobb salad as the appetizer, pulled pork sliders, stampede baked beans and stuffed avocados as the main course, and prairie pecan-crusted flourless chocolate cake with boozy rodeo berries for dessert.

Stephanie may get criticized for her meal being more assembly work than cooking, and for relying heavily on her microwave, which her guests can hear constantly beeping.

The wounds end up being non-life threatening. Psych Crimes and Crises is involved because Idaris suffers from a rare neurological condition called, in layman terms, face blindness, where he cannot recognize faces, and as such he will not be able to identify his attacker. Upon further discussion with Idaris' doctor, Dr. Paul Bruckman, they learn that Idaris is also in the early stages of Alzheimer's despite being only in his early forties. Despite no accurate eyewitness accounts beyond the attacker yelling ""I know you"" - leading to Aidan believing the attack was personally motivated - and being a black man, the team is able to quickly identify the attacker as Benjamin Omari, a refugee from the Congo. In checking his refugee file, they find a photograph of Benjamin as a young teen in the Congo with a man looking like Idaris, but who is identified in the photograph as Melugo, who is wanted in the Congo for war crimes. They have to find out if Idaris and Melugo are one and the same which if so means that this attack was probably not a victimless crime. They also would have to find out how Idaris has been able to masquerade for four years as having this neurological condition under doctor care, the condition which would prevent him from being deported back to the Congo.

"""Criminal Minds"" (2005) {Internal Affairs (#11.9)}"	 Hotch is asked as a favor by Tony Axelrod of the NSA to work on a case of three missing DEA agents in El Paso, Texas who were working on a joint NSA/DEA case to dismantle a Mexican drug cartel called Libertad with both in the field and online components. One of those three agents has since been found murdered, the face of his dead body covered by another dead man's face, that second victim not yet identified. The specific reason Axelrod has asked for this favor is that he believes the agents were given up by a mole, the specific person he suspects being Assistant DEA Director Bernard Graff. Axelrod wants to go this route as he does not want to tip off Graff that he is being investigated (which would be the case if Internal Affairs was conducting the investigation). The BAU would have an outward motive to work on this case as it would be connected to Giuseppe Montolo and the Dirty Dozen case. The only other team member who Hotch is able to confide in as to the rationale for working on this case is Rossi, and as such Garcia in particular optimistically but falsely sees the light at the end of the tunnel for her confinement at BAU HQ as the target of the Dirty Dozen. Hotch is to stay in the DC area to liaise with the cyber unit of the DEA, most specifically Graff and his second in charge in the cyber section of the Libertad case, Agent Adrienne Mitchell, while the rest of the team heads to El Paso to deal with what happened to the missing agents, the murderer unsub who they believe is using the drug violence in the El Paso border area as a cover for his/her own reasons for killing. Hotch may have the more difficult task in that he has to keep suspicions by Graff and Mitchell away from his real mission to discover if Graff is the mole, and if he is not, who is.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	en

Although the D.C. police don't connect her death to any other murders, they call in the BAU because of what was done to her: her lips were cut off. The unsub wants press on the murder as he sent a photograph of Kelly to one of the Georgetown area newspapers. The BAU believe the unsub to be local and that the police have already interviewed him. Based on finding a homeless man living at the crime scene, they determine that the unsub is the man who reported Kelly's murder and who at the time was masquerading as a homeless man. Text found at the crime scene which matches text found on a piece of paper stuffed down Kelly's throat, the three day time frame and the way Kelly was made up when she was found suggest that the unsub is working in some 1950's movie or stage play three act scenario. Another young woman, Penny Hanley, is also determined to be missing and based on their information, the BAU and D.C. police have only one more day to find the unsub before Penny will be killed. Meanwhile, Garcia inadvertently exposes a little of her personal life to the team, a part which she wanted kept to herself.

This is the story of two such leaders - with a deep and deadly hatred for each other. These are the events that lead them to battle. This is the beginning of the Iran/Iraq War. In Iraq, strongman Saddam Hussein is happy hosting the exiled Khomeini when the Ayatollah is making trouble for the Shah of Iran. But when Khomeini and his Shi'ite brethren agitate for revolution inside Iraq itself, Saddam tosses the cleric out. Hussein continues to consolidate power within Iraq - terrorizing friend and foe alike. His murderous secret police enthusiastically dispatch his deadly decrees. Pretending to be devout, the secular Saddam casts himself as the new big man in the Arab world. In 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile in France to take total power in Iran, enjoying a jubilant welcome from Iranians of all political stripes. Professing to be a man of God, Khomeini soon reveals a darker and deadlier face. When Khomeini sees his Shi'ite brethren being brutally evicted from Iraq by Saddam's sycophants, he grows increasingly hostile - attacking Saddam's embassies around the world. The promise of eternal bliss makes bold his extremist followers. In this tale of empires and extremes, of killers and Korans, of God and guns - no one is spared. Death is no deterrent for he who does not fear death. And so nearly a million people die, turning the ancient desert sand red with blood.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

But their fragile nature means the vaccines must be kept constantly cold as they are passed along the supply chain, from freezer to freezer - wherever that may be.

"""Horrid Henry"" (2006)"	 For Horrid Henry, life is just not fair! He feels that the rest of the world is against him and he wages a constant war against the tyranny of adults. Like any headstrong young boy, he is determined, relentless, he doesn't hold back and he never admits defeat! He will stop at nothing to outwit the enemy and teachers, relatives and babysitters avoid him at all costs. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him! Henry is endearingly straight forward and lives for the moment, he'll wolf down his little brother Peter's chocolates before even thinking of an alibi! He doesn't try to be truly horrid, it just comes naturally! He's still young, however, and can be scared by talk of ghosts or monsters. The school doctor's syringe reduces him to a quivering heap! Although Henry is certainly proud of himself, he never learns from his mistakes. Henry indulges in fantasies, transforms into terrifying creatures to match his frustrations and often has 'Eureka moments' when he has what he thinks is a spectacularly wonderful idea. In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire. When he thinks of a plan it is simple to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He takes life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing. No wonder his favorite saying is ... 'it's not fair!!!!' To anyone who suffered at the hands of an older brother, be grateful you don't have a sibling like horrid henry. He can easily make a saint swear with his antics; Nanny 911, Supernanny, Little Angels, house of tiny tear-aways, none of the child specialists behind them could sort him out. Odd however since his brother, Peter is nothing like him, he's everything that Henry isn't and everything Henry's come to despise about how he (Henry) must behave. In short He (Henry) is proof that evolution can go in reverse, surprising his parents haven't packed him off to military school or put him up for adoption...then again he'd most likely be sent back home as neither organization could deal with him.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Hot Streak"" (1986)"	" Unique, but short-lived game on ABC daytime. Two teams of 5 players, men vs. women, competed. In the main game, one member of the team would be given a secret word and would give a description of the word to the next teammate. Once he/she guessed it correctly, s/he would give the next teammate a description of the word, and so forth. This continued down the line, with 40 seconds given for all 4 ""guessers"" to name the secret word. The catch was, no ""key words"" could be duplicated in the various descriptions of the word or else scoring for that secret word would stop. Adding to the difficulty of this task was the fact that the guessers wore headphones that prevented them from hearing how the secret word was described by teammates earlier in the round. Each team had a chance to guess 3 words, and the team with the highest score at the end of the 3 rounds played the bonus round, which was an inverse of the main game. The bonus round was played in 3 rounds. In each round, a team captain was designated and given a word or topic. S/he would then pick 4 words/phrases s/he thought were most associated with the word. The other 4 members of the team wore headphones while the captain picked her 4 clues. The team would hear the topic and then have 20 seconds (5 seconds each) to try to guess the 4 clues that the captain had picked. The first two rounds earned money for a bonus bank each time one of the clues was guessed, while the final round was an all or nothing round that, if won, multiplied the bank earnings by five."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

First up, we talked about our favorite animal attack films. Elric went with the rats in Food of the Gods; Bekah, a once-budding entomologist, chose Slugs; while I, an equal-opportunity abhorrent-animal aficionado, included the whole darn forest from Day of the Animals. Fun fact: I wrote a whole book on critters in the cinema. After that, we dished the dirt on some new movies (Lovely Molly divided us!) and the news (Suspiria remake casting announcements!), and dove right into the chummy waters with John Gulager, who revealed which of his Piranha 3DD cast members was the craziest (when the choices are Christopher Lloyd, David Hasselhoff or Gary Busey, well... you'll just have to watch the show to find out!

Through television contracts and endorsements, college sports has become big business. The college sports industry generates, on average, $11 billion in annual revenues. Seemingly left out of the equation is the ""student athlete."" But with recent landmark cases like the Ed O'Bannon antitrust class action lawsuit against the NCAA, critique and calls for reform of the current status quo have grown louder. What does the future of the NCAA athlete and the university hold? What role does sport play at the university? Should players get paid? What kind of realistic changes can be instituted without severely impacting the sustainability of non-revenue generating NCAA sports? On this episode of Inside Outlook, host Gavin P. Sullivan moderates a discussion on these questions and more. Guests include: Donald Watts - co-founder, Watts Basketball & former UW basketball player. Heather Tarr - head coach, UW softball.

"""Leave It to Beaver"" (1957) {Borrowed Boat (#3.7)}"	" Wally has painstakingly made arrangements to allow Beaver to ride the team bus to his football game, then eat lunch with the team. However, Beaver makes some last-minute plans to go with Larry on an outing to Friends Lake. Wally is very upset and vows never to do any favors for Beaver again. At the lake, Beaver and Larry run into a pair of teen-agers, who say they are searching for some lost oars for their boat; however, the teens are hoodlums who had burglarized the boat shed and duped the two young boys into taking the boat. The hoods run off, and when the police arrive on the scene, Beaver and Larry are caught red-handed. Unable to explain the situation or identify the real culprits, the boys are taken into custody and are told their parents will be called. Wally is the only one who is home when Beaver makes his one phone call, and at first Wally is reluctant to help bail his brother out; however, Beaver tearfully apologizes for the earlier situation, and Wally - feeling obligated to help his brother - goes to the precinct to help bail his brother out. Good thing, too: Beaver lets slip a few important clues about the juveniles' identities, and Wally is able to give names (he knew them as troublemakers at school). When they arrive home, they keep quiet about the situation, but as always, Ward finds out; he is in the room when Wally accepts a phone call from the police department, telling him that the suspects in the boathouse burglary have been arrested. Ward demands an explanation and Wally resists, but Beaver explains the whole thing. June is surprised when Ward goes easy on his sons, but Ward - remembering earlier that Wally and Beaver were on the verge of not speaking to each other - said that this situation helped Wally realize that he needed to set aside his grudge and help Beaver when he was in trouble. Beaver and Larry find themselves in hot water when they are accused of stealing a boat at Friends Lake. Will Wally - upset at Beaver for changing his plans at the last minute when they were supposed to do something together - come to the rescue, or leave his little brother hang out to dry? Rather than take Wally up on his offer to ride on the bus with his football team to their game and sit on the bench during the game, Beaver instead sticks to his already made plan to go on a picnic with Larry to Friend's Lake. Beaver's decision places a strain between Wally and the Beaver, who part as sworn enemies. The picnic is despite, or rather in light of the ""Fun Zone"" at the lake being closed for the season, which in Beaver and Larry's mind will make it more fun as they will have the lake all to themselves. At the lake, they encounter two high school boys in a row boat, they who allow Beaver and Larry to take the boat out on the lake. What Beaver and Larry are unaware of is that the two older boys stole the boat from a locked boat house across the lake. Beaver and Larry are picked up by the police who tell them that the boat was reported stolen, and ultimately taken to the police station for questioning. When a scared Beaver phones home from the police station upon the sergeant's order, the only person at home is Wally. As their last encounter made them sworn enemies, Wally has to decide whether he will help his brother out of this jam, and whether he will blab to their parents about the incident."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Forensic evidence backs the view that he raped Beatrice and the alibi is proved to be false. A friend of his who is blackmailing the three guests is also garroted.

Sister Catherine, the most recent member of the order, turns out to be descended from Sir Anthony Vertue, who donated the priory to the nuns two centuries earlier and Barnaby learns that if the order is ended she will inherit the land and buildings. Father Behan, who heard the nuns' confessions and had long exhorted Mother Julian, the prioress, to sell the premises, is also killed and the missing silver turns up, not stolen but sold by Mother Thomas Aquinas. Then Barnaby learns of an atrocity in Africa thirty years earlier where Mother Julian was a missionary, which could help him solve the case but also put an end to the sacred trust. DCI Barnaby and DS Jones investigate a murder at Midsomer Priory when Mother Thomas Aquinas is found strangled in the chicken coop. Jones had been to the priory earlier after hearing that a stained glass window had been vandalized but the Prioress, Mother Julian, had refused to admit him. The priory had been donated to the Order of Ste. Mathilde two centuries ago and with the death, only three nuns now remain: the Prioress, the wheelchair-bound Mother Jerome and Sister Catherine who is only one week away from taking her final vows. The priory has few visitors the most frequent of which was their chaplain, Father Behan. Aside from the the priory, the nuns also had a valuable collection of silver which included a chalice, two candlesticks and an engraved paten. These have now gone missing, presumably stolen by whoever killed Mother Thomas. It's all too simple for Barnaby. A second murder, a possible inheritance and a deep, dark secret from 30 years ago are all possible leads to identifying the murderer.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Furthermore Barnaby's fingerprints are on a wine glass at Bell's home, an entry in Bell's diary names Barnaby as his guest the evening before his death and Barnaby has no alibi for neither that evening nor the time of the murder. The case is taken over by the unpopular detective inspector Martin Spellman who does not believe that the evidence against Barnaby is fabricated. More deaths occur while Barnaby conducts his own, unofficial investigation to clear his name The battle between traditional film and modern digital photographers becomes far too personal for Tom Barnaby when he becomes the prime suspect in a murder. Lionel Bell is a member of the former group that has recently banned digital photographs from the local photography competition. He's had recent run-ins with Steve Bright, a digital photographer who seems to go out of his way to make the traditionalists miserable.

"""Mission: Impossible"" (1966)"	" Jim Phelps is the head of a super-secret government agency (""Impossible Missions""), and is often given secret anonymous covert missions to attempt; quite often they are unmasking of criminals or the rescuing of hostages. He picks his team depending on which tasks need to be done. One thing is vital on an Impossible Mission: the mission must be carried out in entire secrecy, often relying on high-tech equipment and elaborate deceptions. The Impossible Missions Force is an elite group of agents chosen for their various abilities to infiltrate foreign governments as well as criminal organizations that are seen as threats to the security of the nation. Originally they were lead by Dan Briggs, but he was replaced by Jim Phelps after one year. Among its members are electronics executive Barney Collier, actor and master of disguise Rollin Hand, model Cinnamon Carter and strongman Willy Armitage. In later years Rollin leaves the team and is replaced by another master of disguise simply known as Paris and Cinnamon is replaced first by young Dana Lambert and then Lisa Casey. Mission: Impossible was an Elite Force of agents who were given orders by tape and were asked to do jobs that were Impossible by any other known means. The art of the Con was used time and time again, and the agents used technology, drugs, and plain greed to achieve their goals."	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	en

The only clues are the CEO's last words, obsessively repeated: ""Girls can't eat fifteen pizzas""--and a computerized navigation system that apparently malfunctioned. A talk with the housekeeper and an examination of the wife's separate bedroom lead Monk to an art studio, where he reluctantly interviews a nude male art instructor and discovers that the wife was having an affair with Major League superstar Scott Gregorio, who was attending the same classes. Gregorio, whose on-field performance has deteriorated since an earlier attack by an assailant with a baseball bat, is clearly devastated by Mrs. Hammond's death and is more a victim himself than a suspect. Seeing his own loss of Trudy reflected in Gregorio's loss, Monk befriends the superstar. Along the way to solving the murder, he umpires a Little League game in which Benjy and Stottlemeyer's son, Jared, are on opposing teams.

Chloe's ""Jane Doe"" dead body is found in a house under construction, she killed by several shots by a nail gun. She is eventually identified by one of the home subcontractors, Cam Riley, her boyfriend of three months, the two who were supposed to rendezvous at the house to test out the just installed amazing bathtub the evening before, with Cam needing to cancel their date. It is then that the detectives discover the Wilsons' story... Twenty years ago, Ava Wilson, Chloe and Jessica's mother, was estranged from her husband, Jeremy Sheridan, the children's father. Three year old Chloe was abducted by her father. Jessica, then an adolescent, witnessed the incident, and still feels guilty for not having been able to save her sister. Ava is now close to death, she at stage IV cirrhosis of the liver, with Jessica dedicating her life as her caregiver. Jessica decided once again, after many failed attempts, to hire a private detective to locate Chloe to reunite the family before Ava's imminent passing. This private detective, Ian Mitchell, was able to locate Chloe and reunite the family as per his client Jessica's wishes. Apparently, Chloe was able to escape from her father when she was fifteen, but had never tried to locate her mother or sister as her father long ago told her they were dead. Despite outward harmony displayed by Ava and Jessica toward Chloe, the detectives discover that Ava was providing large sums of money to Chloe without telling Jessica, who may have felt that Chloe was now manipulating Ava in order to receive the bulk of the inheritance. This information, along with an important aspect of a now grown up Chloe's being, places Jessica at the top of the suspect list. However, the rationale for the killing is a little more complicated. Meanwhile, Chief Wells has requested Internal Affairs in the form of Sgt. Saunders to investigate Oscar's interference in the Tim Kelly case, Oscar's move which was all in an effort to protect Brian."	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	en

Only after the pre-Broadway-premiere-interviews Walter admits he was railroaded into appalling changes. The critics do a damned destructive job on the play, worst of all ever-condescending TV columnist Eliot Easterbrook. Shortly after, the Chronicle newspaper critic Danny O'Mara, who gave the only glowing review attacking Elliot's, is found murdered after Easterbrook shouted he should be permanently silenced. Jessica and the NYPD work their way through suspects among cast, crew and critical body, starting with Eliot who was found there holding a gun but has a TV alibi, only to find the killer after examining notes and computer files. Jessica is in New York City to attend the premiere of a play, Mainely Murder, that is based on one of her novels. Everyone, including the young playwright Walter Knapf, is nervous about opening night and what the reviewers may have to say. One of those reviewers, Elliot Easterbrook, is known for being particularly nasty and vile and sure enough, his review is devastating. To everyone's great joy however, the reviewer for the Chronicle Danny O'Mara - considered to be the most important - is highly positive, praising the production to the hilt. He also has some disparaging remarks in his column about Easterbrook.

Not so, as the autopsy determines that O'Mara had been dead for several hours when his body and Easterbrook were found together.

Each week, two teams (as chosen months in advance by the NFL) met in what has become a Monday night tradition. Usually, a trio of sports-casters (a play-by-play announcer joined by a color commentator and an analyst) called the action. Half-time interviews with coaches and players, and sideline reports after outstanding plays were also innovations that contributed to the appeal of these games. Many of the games proved to be exciting, though sometimes the games were boring (especially if the teams were a mismatch or not very good, a necessary risk since the games were scheduled months in advance). Often serving as part of the announcing team were former NFL greats including OJ Simpson, Dan Dierdorf, Joe Namath and Lynn Swann."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	en

"""Nature"" (1982) {Unforgettable Elephants (#25.9)}"	 We have seen them dressed in costumes and dancing at circuses, living solitary lives at zoos or giving our children a thrill with a ride on their back. But the largest land animals live a life that is completely foreign to us when left to their own in the wild -- one complete with battles and births, kidnappings and camaraderie. More than fifteen years ago, Martyn Colbeck began to document in film and photos the lives of African elephants. For the better part of two decades, he has grown particularly close to the elephant matriarch, Echo, and her close-knit family, who have never failed to astonish, amuse, and inspire him. The family seems to accept Colbeck into their world, and perhaps even considers him one of their own. The result is that he can record unimpeded the gentle love, and tight bonds that elephants feel for each other. Colbeck's film gives us a glimpse into the complex world of elephant society. We meet Echo and begin to understand the importance of such a majestic matriarch to her devoted clan. He shows us their language and ways of communication. And he captures remarkable scenes such as the rare birth of a crippled calf that the family desperately and collectively tries to help to its feet. The film causes us to question if this could be about more than simply survival. Is there a deeper emotion we have just been privileged enough to witness through Colbeck's lens? In scene after moving scene, Colbeck makes us fall in love with Echo, Erin, Enid, Ely, and the rest of this loving family. He conveys through his film and in a special interview with NATURE what complicated, powerful, tender, funny -- and, yes, unforgettable -- creatures elephants are.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Nine for IX"" (2013) {The '99ers (#1.8)}"	" The world of women's sports was kicked upside down on July 10, 1999. Before a sold-out crowd of more than 90,000 at the Rose Bowl and an estimated 40 million Americans watching on television, the women's soccer team reached a cultural and athletic pinnacle with its penalty-kick shoot-out victory over China to win the Women's World Cup. These players were more than the pony-tailed poster girls celebrated by mainstream media. As told through the voice of a longtime team captain, Julie Foudy, we get an inside look at the strong team ethic and rare ""do for each other"" mentality that propelled them to victory that day and turned the team into a cultural touchstone. With unprecedented access, the film uses candid, behind-the-scenes footage shot by the players themselves during the tournament to present a unique portrait of the women who irrevocably changed the face of women's athletics. Reuniting key players from the 1999 squad and talking with current U.S. players as well, the film will examine how women's soccer - and women's sports as a whole - has changed since that epic day at the Rose Bowl."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	en

Sarah assumes her identity hoping that cleaning out the dead woman's bank account will solve all of her problems. Instead, the street smart chameleon is thrust headlong into a kaleidoscopic mystery. After taking on the new identity, Sarah quickly finds herself caught in the middle of a deadly conspiracy and must race to find answers. On a train platform, Sarah sees a woman calmly remove her shoes and then place her neatly folded jacket on top of them. She turns and calmly steps in front of an oncoming train. For Sarah however it's as if she was looking at herself in a mirror as the now dead woman looked just like her. Sarah steals the woman's purse and adopts her identity, Elizabeth Childs, but has a lot to learn about her in a very short time. She quickly realizes she may have stepped into a life that is far more complicated - and dangerous - than her own. Childs was a police detective who is under investigation for shooting an unarmed woman. She was also taking medication. Sarah's plan to empty Beth's Bank account goes well but she isn't expecting to meet Katia - another woman who looks just like her. Ten months ago, Brit Sarah Manning dropped her infant daughter Kira off with ""Mrs. S"", then left Toronto without notice. Sarah, who has scammed her way through life, has just returned to Toronto, and stolen a large stash of coke from her old boyfriend Vic, that coke which she plans to sell for several thousand dollars, which is enough to support Kira for a little while. At a train station, Sarah sees someone who looks exactly like her take off her shoes, drop her purse on the ground, and commit suicide by walking in front of a moving train. By grabbing the dead woman's purse, Sarah learns that she is Beth Childs. By going to Beth's apartment, Sarah learns that Beth leads a pretty high end life, and has just recently opened a savings account with $75,000. Sarah decides to switch focus by assuming Beth's life in order to drain her bank account, which would allow her to escape to start a new life with Kira and her gay foster brother Felix, her best friend. Felix, acting the mourning brother, will identify the dead body as Sarah's. Sarah learns that this task may be more difficult than originally planned as she has to learn on the fly much about Beth's life, especially about her boyfriend Paul, and Beth's job which ends up surprising Sarah. Another problem is Felix convincing Vic that Sarah is dead, as Vic does not trust either him or Sarah, who he knows stole his drugs. But Sarah will learn more about Beth's life by what she finds in Beth's safety deposit box and what ends up in the back seat of Beth's car, these revelations which may make Sarah regret taking Beth's identity."	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Finch and Root have been working around the clock trying to rehabilitate the Machine, which has been made all the more difficult especially for Root since their undercover identities have been breached meaning that they have to remain sequestered in the subway, while Reese, who has managed to remain above ground undercover as Fusco's NYPD partner, reports back that Homicide has been remarkably quiet of late, allowing him to reflect more on the truly lonely state of his personal life. Finch and Root believe they may have come up with a solution to their most serious problem of not enough computer power to keep the Machine going. They will only know if the Machine is functioning properly when Reese and Fusco start working on the latest numbers supplied by the Machine, thirty of them in one go. What Reese and Fusco discover is that the Machine has lost all sense of context, which, based on Finch's assessment, means that they have to do some triage to determine which of those thirty truly are credible current numbers. After doing that work, Reese and Fusco decide to focus on two, a Tulsa tourist named Laurie Granger, and Gerald Mancini, who has ties to illegal gambling. But what Finch, Root and Reese will also discover is that the issue of context will also place their own lives in danger, unless Finch can fix the Machine, which is easier said than done.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	en

"""Philosophie"" (2008) {Corrida (#6.3)}"	 Bullfighting is pure barbarism or a ritual? Is it a game, a sport, a play, or even an art? In answering this question are known to excrete the spirits. The bullfight is but one thing: the moment of encounter between a mighty fighting bull and the bullfighter, his jacket, his garment of light, and the Muleta, the red cloth. What is the appeal of this, at first glance, so unfair fight? Firstly based ethics, which is based on the bullfight, that wants to fight the bull by its very nature, it represents the purity of the fighter. Equally essential is the respect for the animal: To kill it, the bullfighter put his own life at risk. Thus he gives him the proper respect. The matador needed moral and aesthetic virtues and also the bull boldness and sophistication inevitably apply as a prerequisite for an authentic bullfight. But not even an outrageous arrogance hiding behind the alleged ethics that threatens to topple into the ridiculous? And why must the bull eventually die forever?

Three weeks ago, Joby ran off and has been on the run since. Corelli knows that Joby now has Tod in his sights as a mark in whatever scheme Joby has in mind.

"""Sale of the Century"" (1969)"	" In this quiz/game show, contestants had to answer relatively simple questions on general knowledge categories. Correct answers earned the contestants a few dollars. The show's gimmick was that the contestants could then exchange some of their money for expensive prizes which would be offered at extreme discounts. The contestant who finished the show with the most cash could then return to compete in the next show. ""Sale of the Century"" was the American game show that, after its network cancellation in the United States, became a phenomenal hit on Australia's Nine Network. 3 contestants, 1 a returning champion, competed to answer general knowledge questions (asked rapid-fire style). Each contestant was given an initial score of $25; correct answers were worth $5, wrong answers deducted $5 from the score. The game was interrupted at certain intervals for Instant Bargains, which allowed the player in the lead to buy a prize at a heavily-discounted take-it-or-leave-it prize (e.g., a $1,175 color TV/stereo console for $14) always at the risk of later losing the game at times, the host offered cash or reduced the asking price as an additional incentive to buy the prize. Toward the end of the front game, the questions were increased to $10 added or subtracted appropriately. After an undefined time limit had expired, the contestant with the highest cash score was the day's champion and earned the right to shop in the ""Sale of the Century""; the losers received their cash score and any Instant Bargain prizes. In the ""Sale of the Century,"" the champion could use his cash score winnings to buy specially-discounted luxury items (e.g., a $2800 dining room suite for $85) or bank the cash and return on the next show and accumulate more by winning future games and having access to more expensive prizes including a luxury car and a cash jackpot that began at $25,000 and increased by $1000 per show until claimed; a champion who earned enough cash could elect to take home all the prizes offered in the ""Sale of the Century,"" which together was often worth more than $50,000. Late in the NBC run, the format was altered so that 2 male/female couples competed with late-game questions worth $20 and the winning couple going shopping; the original format was used in the one-season syndicated version. Though a modest hit in the U.S. (in both the 1969 and 1983 versions), the show became a huge hit on Australia's Nine Network; the Australian version was the brainchild of Reg Grundy, who purchased the rights to the show shortly after its network cancellation in 1973."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Simon Schama's Power of Art"" (2006) {Rembrandt (#1.3)}"	 Host Simon Schama uses wit and insight to review the life and career of the great Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn. Using his paintings as reference, Schama details his early brilliance, through his high years as Amsterdam's go-to guy for realistic portraits, to his bankruptcy and decline as his refused to compromise his artistic vision to please his patrons. In the 1630s, technically infallible Rembrandt van Rhijn excelled in all popular genres, especially sharp portraits, in booming trade-port Amsterdam, where recent wealth was eagerly displayed. His work was more personal and original then conventional contemporary masters like Rubens and Velasquez. He was a miller's smart seventh child from nearby college city Leyden, but chose an oil-painting apprenticeship instead, even made a self-portrait as poor budding artist, whose greatest talent was 'story-telling', soon senior partner in a flourishing Amsterdam arts trading and schooling firm which produced paintings to order, with Uylenbergh, whose rich niece Saskia, heiress of a Leeuwarden mayor, became his wife and muse, often portrayed as flower-girl. Success by portraying wealth with appropriate protestant modesty allowed him an extravagant home and collecting. In his 1640 showpiece De Nachtwacht, a formula theme devoted to the textile guild which doubled as city militia, he abandoned the predictable board room-line up for a clever, original drama perspective composition, romanticizing the rich toy soldiers as if battle troops combining field action with discipline. Soon after clients questioned his liberties, income dwindles, Saskia is consumed by TBC in 1642, he turned from flamboyant theatricality to simpler sentiment and common life themes, even his maid-mistress Hendrikje Stoffels, just when the new generation and the the Westphalia peace treaties turned the Dutch Republic cheerful, boisterous and refined, hence Italianate, so he went out of favor as 'boring' old-fashioned and went bankrupt in 1656, but persisted in his unfashionable idiosyncrasies. Yet he got had one last shot at a comeback, a commission for the new city hall, to depict the Batavian Claudius Civilis's rebellion against the Romans, but he still dared present an unacceptable orgy of ugly barbarity he had to cut up after refusal, only the central fifth survives.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Snapped"" (2004) {Darlene Gentry (#6.16)}"	 Pretty, petite Darlene Doskocil and handsome, outgoing Keith Gentry met at their small Texas college. They started dating when they discovered a mutual love of beer, dancing, and deer hunting. When she finished up her nursing degree, she moved to Dallas for work, but Keith charmed her back into the small town life in Robinson, Texas. They got married and had three boys, but their marriage soon began to show signs of strain. With Keith working long hours, Darlene frequently left the kids with Keith's parents while she went out with friends. Concerned, Keith quit his high-paying job so he could be home for the kids when Darlene was away. Then, just after 6 a.m. on November 9, 2005, Darlene called 911 to say her house had been broken into and her husband had been shot. Paramedics found Keith lying in bed unconscious; he died a few hours later. Friends and family rushed to console Darlene over the death of her husband. She and the kids moved in with Keith's parents. But as police investigated Keith's murder, the evidence began to mount against Darlene. First, there was the murder scene. Investigators claimed it looked staged. Then, police found rubber gloves at the bottom of the kitchen trashcan, which contained shell casings, gunshot residue, and only two DNA profiles: Keith's and Darlene's. Police also found it suspicious that although Darlene was a nurse, she had made no apparent effort to save her husband. But, the most damning evidence was a secret video made by Texas Rangers. The video captured Darlene as she systematically searched the bottom of a pond-in the exact spot where the murder weapon had been found two days earlier. It took a jury only 5 hours to convict Darlene of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to 60 years.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Souten Kouro (Los Tres Reinos)"" (2009)"	 Souten Kouro's story is based loosely on the events taking place in Three Kingdoms period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao (155 - March 15, 220), who also serves as the main character. The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade. A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Outside, the search is for the tombs of the humbler builders of the most monumental royal tomb and their intricate life during decades of well-planned work, which prove too elaborate to be a mere slave camp, rather a privileged village of superior craftsmen, and next to it, exceptionally behind a stone wall, a huge storage area, the whole is even considered a new step in the development of a court-centered modern state model.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

The Maquis ship is destroyed in a battle with the warlike Kazons. To prevent a Kazon aggression against a helpless world, Voyager destroys the space probe. Without the probe, it will take 75 years for Voyager to travel back to Federation space.

If it isn't for Neelix, they couldn't save the abducted Marquis and Starfleet Operations Manager Harry Kim from the Ocampa world. This world is threatened by a race called the Kazon. Through the Caretaker, they meet the Marquis and decide to become allies because the situation doesn't look promising. They eventually will get at war with the Kazon since they want to have the - already dieing - Cartaker's station and destroy the Ocampa.

When they enter the badlands, something happens and they find themselves in the Delta Quadrant which is 70,000 light years away. They find the Maquis they were searching for led by Commander Chakotay. They learn that they were brought there by a being known as the Caretaker who was looking for someone to take his place as he was dying and it's his job to look after the Ocampa, an alien race, who is constantly being threatened by the Kazon. Janeway convinces the Caretaker to let the Ocampa fend for themselves but before he could return them he dies and knowing that the Kazon would use the Caretaker's technology to conquer the Ocampa Janeway destroys his ship leaving them stranded in the Delta Quadrant. They have no choice but to try and find a way to return to their own universe which would take them many years at their best speed. Janeway decides to take in Chakotay and his people and make them crewmembers. Also joining them is Neelix, a Talaxian, who helps them get through this unknown quadrant, and Kes, an Ocampan. Now the ship's regular doctor was killed, so for their medical needs, they have to rely on the EMH or Emergency Medical Hologram, which is a hologram of a doctor.

Adding to his troubles, are (1) his wife runs off with a bellhop, (2) his 17-year-old son has muscle instead of brains in his head, (3) his crew down at the firehouse are ""strange"": Feldmand tells his mother he is a doctor instead of a fireman, Rosetti has only sex on the brain and Max, a Hispanic, speaks fractured English.

"""Stargate SG-1"" (1997) {Bloodlines (#1.11)}"	 An experimental drug to replace Teal'c's goa'uld as his immune system is unsuccessful, and gives him nightmares about the traumatic implantation in his own body, a prim'ta which turns a Jaffa child into a goa'uld drone, and it's impending for his son Ry'ac, about whom he never told the USAF. Now he tells Jack and proposes a mission to retrieve symbionts on his home planet Chulac, where they are plentiful, but their last visit made them many enemies. Once informed, the general orders a team mission rather than virtual suicide by Teal'c going alone. They pretend to be a legation from Apophis, bluff their way past priests guarding the stargate, and find Teal'c's home burned down as part of his disgrace as shol'va (traitor) but meet Jaffa master Brae'tac, his mentor, who expected him to return to his family for Ry'ac's prim'ta ceremony and shows him and Jack where they live as kresh'ta (outcasts) in a slum, just in time to prevent the ceremony, to his wife Drey'auc's fury, who told Ry'ac he was an orphan; Jack sees the boy is suffering from scarlet fever, but can't guarantee full healing even on earth. In the meantime Teal'c implants his own symbiont. Daniel and Sam trace a real party of Apophis's priests who deliver symbionts to a temple, and they steal a sample; Daniel destroys the rest over Sam's protests. Although it's not quite mature, Brae'tac uses it to save Teal'c, who must return to earth if possible... After a failed attempt to remove the Goa'uld larva from Teal'c, he tells them that he left his wife Drey'auc and son Rya'c behind. His son is about to come of age at which time he will be implanted with a Goa'uld larva and forever be their slave. They return to Chulac but find Teal'c's former home to have been destroyed and marked as the home of a traitor. They are joined by Master Bra'tac, Teal'c's one-time teacher who leads them to the encampment where his wife and son are being kept. Once there however, it is evident that his wife is quite prepared to let her son be infected to benefit from the lifestyle the boy's new status will afford them. Rya'c is quite ill as well and with the boy's condition deteriorating rapidly, there is only one solution left to him. Teal'c is unsuccessfully submitted to a surgery to remove his Goa'uld. Then he tells that he needs to meet his family, since his son Rya'c will receive his Goa'uld larva soon and he wants to avoid it. Jack convinces Hammond to let the SG-1 go. Jack, Daniel and Sam go to Chulak with Teal'c disguised as Apophis' team members. When they reach Teal'c's home, they find it burned down to the ground. However they encounter Teal'c's mentor Bra'tac that explains that his family is living in a camp for outcast. Teal'c rescues his son, but his wife discloses that he is sick and only a Goa'uld larva can save him. What will Teal'c do?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Stargate SG-1"" (1997) {Unnatural Selection (#6.12)}"	 Having regained control of the X-303, the SG-1 team finds itself in an unknown part of space. Rescue comes in the form of the Asgard, specifically Thor, who needs their help. The Asgard home world has been overrun by the Replicators and they require SG-1's help as well as the relatively low tech X-303. The Asgard had set a trap for the Replicators and hoped to use a time dilation device that would give them the time they need to find a way to defeat them. The problem is that the Replicators have turned off the device and the Asgard want SG-1 to go in and activate it. They accept the assignment but to meet their objective, O'Neill will face a moral dilemma. The Asgard home galaxy has been over-run by the replicators, and they ask for SG-1's help. The Asgard believed they had trapped the replicators with a device that would slow down time, but it seems to have failed. They need SG-1 to enter replicator infested space, find the time dilation machine and reset it. When SG-1 land at the designated point, they meet 5 individuals, who control the replicators. The others reveal that they are an evolution of the replicators - composed of micro-cellular replicator blocks, and modeled on Reese, who created the original replicators. These others have reset the time machine so that time is moving more quickly within this area of space - to allow them to evolve and build an enormous army that can invade the rest of space. The minds of the team are probed by the first 4 others. However, the last member of the others (called Fifth) seems reluctant - he is described as weak by First, the leader of the replicators. He was an attempt to model Reese more fully, but the mistake will not be repeated. Carter senses his reluctance to probe her mind, but invites him to do so - and they agree a plan. Fifth will reset the time dilation machine to run slowly, and he will escape with the SG team. While time is passing slowly for his brethren, the Asgard will have hundreds of years to fix the mistake in the others. Fifth has to leave later than the SG team to avoid arousing the suspicion of the others; Jack orders Carter to set the timer on the device to activate earlier than Fifth has been told. SG-1 escape successfully as the time dilation device reverses the trend within the area of space, and makes time run much more slowly. However, Fifth is caught by his brethren, and realizes that Carter had broken her promise not to leave without him. Carter and Jonas regret using Fifth's humanity against him, but even though Jack seems uncomfortable, he declares that Fifth wasn't human, and they made the only correct choice.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

It seems a simple enough assignment that even Grant should be able to handle it but Rip has been grounded for a week by his mother. So Grant is on his own. At the subsequent classic car show where Grant is acting as driver and bodyguard to the car, he is mortified to encounter the last person in the world he would ever want to meet - actor Reed Carrol, the man whose success Grant has always resented. Carrol is showing off his car, the famous custom-built Silver Bullet. After the show, Davies chauffeurs the Rolls Royce home himself and tells Grant to drive the empty trailer back. Parking as instructed, Grant is unable to avoid losing his shoes - and his dignity - in the mud. He is astonished to find an insurance company investigator on his doorstep the following morning. The Silver Bullet has been stolen and Grant's gloves and fingerprints have been found inside the car's empty trailer. Desperate to prove his innocence, Grant is certain that Reed Carrol has stolen his own car for the insurance money and is trying to frame him. Heavily disguised - as a priest - Grant pays an exploratory visit to Carrol's house where he is instantly recognized by the amiable actor and invited in. Carrol, in fact, wants to hire him to find the missing car. The next day, the burnt out wreck of the Silver Bullet is found in a ditch. To deflect police suspicion that Grant is responsible, he and Rip head for the scene of the crime but have to make a quick exit when it transpires that Grant's footprints clearly match the prints around the wreck. Grant goes on the run from the police. With his superior powers of analyze, it doesn't take Rip long to figure out that Grant did steal the Silver Bullet - but without knowing it. The trailer he drove home from the car show was not empty after all but contained the stolen car. Grant then left his footprints in the thick mud at Davies' house and Davies was able to make plaster moulds and leave imprints around the car wreck. The final piece of the jigsaw falls into place when Rip also realizes that the Silver Bullet was not the wrecked car. HE and Grant draw the investigators to the showrooms of Noyes, a classic car salesman and Bruce Davies' partner in crime. Davies makes a run for it in the unscathed Silver Bullet but is dramatically halted by heroic action from Grant - much to everyone's astonishment. The car is saved, Grant's innocence is proven and a way is even found to placate Rip's irate mother.

"""Street Legal"" (2000) {The Juror (#2.11)}"	 When Trudi, a young waitress, is found strangled, David is called upon to defend her employer, Daniel Kent. Daniel's protestations of innocence aren't helped by the fact that he was tried and acquitted of a murder with exactly the same MO 6 years earlier. However, Daniel's father Alan assures David that he will leave no stone unturned to prove his son's innocence. David discovers Trudi was having a relationship with a retired barrister, Ritchie Wells, despite their 40 year age gap. Wells was also the barrister who acted for Daniel in the last trial. When Wells rings David and arranges to meet, David is anxious to talk to him, but David and Tim arrive too late - they find Wells' body. He appears to have taken his own life. David appeals to Kees to drop the case against Daniel as Wells was obviously the murderer - Wells' suicide confirms his guilt. Kees is swayed, but not convinced. David and Joni find it increasingly difficult to work together as David's jealousy of Joni and Kees' relationship starts to infect the workplace. Tim backs away from their bickering and follows his own line of inquiry - the pathologist's report reveals small amounts of gold found in Trudi's stomach. Joni is contacted by an old client of hers, Joy, who has a shocking admission. She claims to have been forewoman of the jury on the original murder case 6 years ago and says she was paid by Ritchie Wells to convince the jury of Daniel's innocence. When Joni brings David in to hear the news he quickly terminates the discussion, telling Joni this is detrimental to their client and puts them in a dangerous position, ethically. But David puts it to Daniel that he corrupted the jury last time around. Daniel denies all knowledge of Joy. That night, Joy gets a threatening visit from a figure who throws bleach in her face then warns her that next time it will be acid. She is petrified and decides to recant her story. When DNA results come back putting Daniel's skin under Trudi's fingernails and her blood on his shirt, he is arrested for murder. Under pressure from David, Daniel admits he was indeed there the night Trudi was killed- he was responding to a call for help from Trudi. Ritchie had become violent. Daniel intervened in the fight, stopped Wells from beating Trudi, then left, thinking Wells had calmed down and the situation was under control. Kees eventually persuades Joy to talk to them. Joy tells Kees about the attack on her. David tells Daniel that Daniel must have orchestrated the attack on Joy, because Daniel was the only one who knew about Joy. He's disgusted with the under-hand tactics and tells Daniel to get another lawyer. That seems like a good decision, when Kees tells David that Wells did not commit suicide but was in fact murdered. And it seems an even better decision when Tim tells David that Wells also had the same gold residue in his stomach as Trudi - and the victim murdered 6 yrs earlier. Tim's also spotted that the two girls were murdered on the same day and date. When Daniel's father tries to bribe him to continue with a new car, David returns the keys, then realizes who bribed Joy 6 years ago. He also sees something else of interest in Alan's office, which helps convince him not to abandon Daniel's defense. David enlists Samson's reluctant help to break into Alan's office and secure a critical piece of evidence for analysis - a bottle of the gold liqueur habitually imbibed by Alan. David gives it to Kees to analyze believing it will match the gold found in all 3 victim's stomachs. David then cross-examines Daniel who finally breaks down and admits that it is his father he is protecting. David passes the information to Kees who becomes extremely agitated because he knows that Joni, unaware of developments pointing towards Alan as the murderer, has gone to interview Alan about whether the dates the girls were both murdered on have any significance for Daniel. Kees tries to ring Joni but her phone is off. In Alan's office, Joni's questions about the date produce a dangerous reaction in Alan. It becomes apparent that the date in question is when Daniel's mother abandoned them. Alan is clearly bitter and twisted towards Daniel's mother - and women generally. Joni realizes the link too late - Alan locks the door and attacks her. Joni is fighting for her life, when Kees bursts into the room and beats Alan into submission. David informs Daniel he is a free man and that his father can now get the help he needs. As Kees cradles Joni, David walks alone down the long corridor from Daniel's cell.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

As a husband and father of a 2-year-old son, he writes children's songs and still loves to play guitar. Three months ago, however, Dominic was struck by a series of sudden seizures. MRI scans found a tumor the size of a plum on the left frontal side of his brain - right next to the area that controls his guitar-playing hand. It's so close to other vital areas like speech that leading UCLA neurosurgeon Dr. Linda Liau proposed doing the surgery while he was awake. Dr. Liau wants to make sure she cuts the entire tumor out, but she also want to preserve as much of his normal brain function as possible. If Dominic is conscious during surgery, the medical team can interrogate him to find out what each part of his brain does, before making an irreversible cut. This film is a startling exploration of one woman's lifelong fight to conquer brain tumors, both by breathtaking surgical technique and by her pioneering development and testing of brain tumor vaccines. It's also a cutting-edge journey into mapping music and creativity in the human brain.

Ann and Donald go to the restaurant to speak to Lew's longtime maitre d' Harry to see if anything is the matter with Lew. What they find out is that the restaurant is nearly empty, a situation that has been in existence for the past half year, while one of their rivals, Tony's, which doesn't have nearly the quality of food as La Parisienne, has to turn customers away. It's because Tony's has a hip, young vibe punctuated by the live rock music, as opposed to the staid saxophone/accordion combo playing at La Parisienne. Ann wants to try and help her father by convincing him to update La Parisienne by hiring a rock combo of his own, but she wants for him to think it was his own idea. With advice from Donald and Ann on the specific group, Lew does hire the Blue Boys, the least offensive group to his own sensibilities.

As the drunken couple argue on the stern of a yacht, the normally-timid husband shoves her overboard to drown. The society party-goers on the boat support his tale that the wife accidentally fell over the side that night, & the police believe the husband too.

"""The Amazing Race"" (2001) {Clearly, I'm More Intelligent Than You (#5.1)}"	" Eleven teams leave Santa Monica Pier and make their way to Montevideo, Uruguay, where they must locate a statue known as the ""hand in the sand."" In Uruguay, teams must carry a side of beef one-half mile, and then face the detour of ""zips or chips"" (zip lining from a hotel roof or playing roulette) before arriving at the pit stop. On the Santa Monica Pier in California, Phil Keoghan starts eleven teams on the adventure of a life time and warns them of a new twist in the race. Teams for the fifth installment of The Amazing Race are as follows: 1. Chip and Kim: married, 2. Colin and Christie: models, 3. Brandon and Nicole: models, 4. Linda and Karen: bowling Moms, 5. Kami and Karli: identical twins, 6. Charla and Mirna: cousins, 7. Marshal and Lance: brothers, 8. Bob and Joyce: dating via Internet, 9. Jim and Marsha: father and daughter, 10. Alison and Donny: the Big Brother 4 runner-up and her boyfriend, 11. Dennis and Erika: formerly engaged. As teams race off the pier, Marsha's father, Jim, falls and injures his knee which requires stitches and nearly causes his team to miss the flight. Teams make their way to Los Angeles International airport where they will fly to Montevideo, Uruguay, where they must locate the ""hand in the sand""--a statue on the beach. Once they find the clue, teams travel by ferry to Gorriti Island. On the island, they must find times for ferries leaving the next morning--the timed tickets are hidden on eleven of one hundred trees. The next morning, teams travel by ferry to the suburb of Maldonado, where they carry a 55-pound side of beef for one-half mile from a warehouse to a local butcher. The new twist in the race is revealed: teams may use a Yield which can slow down any team for a predetermined amount of time. Upon completing the task of carrying the meat, teams go to the Conrad Hotel in Punte Del Este and complete a detour: zips or chips. In zips, teams ride a zip line 18 stories from the hotel's roof and drop into the hotel's swimming pool. In chips, teams play roulette with 20 chips in the hotel's casino--the number they bet on must be a winner. Karli, Kami, Chip and Kim all miss the important step of finding the route marker directing them to the detour, but luck into the detour on their own. Once teams finish the detour, they head for the pit stop at the Casa Del Pueblo. When Karli, Kami, Chip and Kim arrive at the pit stop, Phil sends them back to find the route marker--delaying their arrival at the pit stop. So due to the mistake, teams officially arrive in the following order: 1. Alison and Donny, 2. Marshall and Lance, 3. Linda and Karen, 4. Bob and Joyce, 5. Charla and Mirna, 6. Brandon and Nicole, 7. Colin and Christie, 8. Chip and Kim, 9. Kami and Karli, 10. Jim and Marsha, 11. Dennis and Erika. Since they were the last to arrive, Dennis and Erika are eliminated from the race."	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Howard video chats with Bernadette who is mad at him for not telling his mother that they are moving out. He buckles under to his mother and then tells Bernadette that everything worked out, thus lying to both of the women in his life. He may decide to stay in space. Problems exist between all three couples. Howard, still in space, apparently didn't tell his mother that he and Bernadette are not planning on living with her, which in her eyes means that Bernadette is stealing her baby. Bernadette ends up taking the bulk of Mrs. Wolowitz's wrath, which she in turn vents on Howard. With which woman will Howard side? Things are still slightly uncomfortable between Leonard and Penny, ever since Leonard's impromptu proposal of marriage while they were having sex. While Leonard wants to talk about it, Penny doesn't. On their second anniversary date, Amy and Sheldon have the exact opposite problem, at least in Amy's mind. She is still hoping for so much more to happen with Sheldon, and she hopes that their supposed romantic anniversary dinner will be that impetus. A move by Sheldon demonstrates where his mind is at with regard to Amy. Meanwhile, a lonely Raj moves from one couple's date to another. He ends up in an unexpected place by the end of the evening."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en
"""The Big Bang Theory"" (2007) {The Jerusalem Duality (#1.12)}"	 Fifteen year old genius Dennis Kim is a physics doctoral candidate who Gablehauser wants at the college at any cost. Dennis is much like Sheldon was at that age, with the ego and arrogance to match. As such, Sheldon doesn't like Dennis, especially after Dennis criticizes Sheldon's work on string theory, which is his primary research. But Sheldon realizes that one of the comments Dennis makes about his research is indeed true. For Sheldon, this realization means the end of his life as he knows it. Much to his genius friends' chagrin, Sheldon needs to find something academic to do, and who better to do it with than other geniuses (albeit less so than him). So Leonard, Howard and Raj decide that to get Sheldon back to the top of the heap status they need to take Dennis down a few notches by refocusing his fifteen year old mind on more pubescent pursuits.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en
"""The Big Bang Theory"" (2007) {The Romance Recalibration (#10.13)}"	 Penny laments not only that Leonard no longer does romantic things for her like he used to before and when they first got married, but that he doesn't even seem to try anymore, the latter which makes her feel like he takes her for granted. Although she is reluctant to do so, Penny tells Leonard what is bothering her, which leads to a fight between the two, Leonard who feels he has made all the effort throughout their entire relationship. Penny decides she needs some time away from Leonard, and as such takes Amy on the romantic trip to the spa she had originally planned with Leonard. As Penny and Leonard turn to Amy and Sheldon respectively for advice and support, they may come to a drastic conclusion about what needs to be done. Meanwhile, Howard has discovered that the wood floor in Halley's bedroom squeaks. Despite Casey's advice to Bernadette that they just rip out and replace the entire floor, Howard and Raj try to figure out ways not to make the existing floor squeak, Raj wanting them to think outside the box. And Sheldon has decided to make an effort to be more interested in the goings-on in other people's lives, despite in doing so he coming into some knowledge overload of a certain kind.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

Although Don denies that he and Dan threw the weigh-in as a sign of ""giving up"", Bob and Jillian are certain he and Dan did. The on-ranch contestants participate in the ultimate temptation challenge in facing the specific foods that are their individual weaknesses. The winner of the challenge gets to choose the team that will train with Cara and Brett for the week off the ranch. That team finds the off campus training has some good and not so good elements. That team returns to the ranch for a reward challenge, which combines knowledge of their weakness foods once again and a test of strength.

Whoever eats the most calories gets to choose which team will go train with the ""unknowns"" and the new trainers.

"""The Biggest Loser"" (2004) {The Playoffs (#16.12)}"	 Host Alison Sweeney surprises the contestants with the news that this week they'll be competing as singles, rather than as teams. In their first challenge as singles, the players must cross an obstacle course, including a mud pit, and complete a memory puzzle at the end for the greatest prize of all at the ranch - immunity. Then trainers surprise the final seven contestants with heartwarming videos of support from players, coaches and family members back home, fueling their fire to keep working hard at the ranch. Later, after a fiercely competitive week at Comeback Canyon, trainer Bob Harper sends one player home for good, while the ranch weigh-in results in a tearful elimination as the contestants vote to send another player packing. At the last sets of weigh-ins, Rondalee is eliminated at Comeback Canyon sending her home, while Scott joins Damien at Comeback Canyon. Bob likens the competition this week at Comeback Canyon as the equivalent of the Super Bowl, with two former NFL'ers going head to head to remain in the game. Bob uses that football background to motivate the two. Back at the ranch, Ali tells the remaining seven contestants that they are now in what she considers the playoffs, and to win the title, they have to do it alone as singles, meaning no more teams. The contestants are however free to train with whomever they like. Regardless of the single status, some feel that they are on the outside as old team alliances will probably be retained, especially among the original white team members. The week's reward challenge has what for many is the ultimate prize for the winner: immunity from elimination at this week's weigh-in, at which the contestants will face a yellow line. The challenge entails a mud-slicked obstacle course and recreating a sixteen-piece color-coded puzzle displayed at one end of the course at the other, the first person to recreate that puzzle correctly being the winner. In the lead up to the weigh-in, Dolvett feels he needs to help Toma overcome the one pound weight gain he had last week.

They are even more excited following the audition about being approached by the young and hip Tami Cutler, a talent agent, who implies that she wants to represent them. She and her business partner Buddy Berkman eventually meet solely with Greg because they aren't interested in representing the entire group, but Greg alone. Outfitting him a flashy matador styled suit, they want him to be a solo act and to use the stage name Johnny Bravo. Despite feeling that he is letting his siblings down by not having them included in the deal, Greg eventually gets caught up in the potential of fame and fortune and contemplates going ahead with the deal. Greg's act initially places a strain between himself and his siblings, who do feel that he acted in his own self-interest despite earlier agreeing that they are not individuals but a group, and between himself and his parents, who don't want him to forgo a college education. But Greg may come to a final decision on the deal after spending more time with Tami and Buddy and learning their motivation for wanting to sign him specifically. A sexy, slick-talking talent agent named Tami Rogers talks Greg into abandoning his family singing act to sign a solo recording contract. The upshot: Greg would become Johnny Bravo, the world's next superstar. Greg agrees at first, but winds up alienating his siblings (because they think he wanted to dump them all along) and upsetting his parents when he plans to postpone college. However, Greg walks out when he finds out his recordings have been ""sweetened"" and that Tami and her associate only wanted some naive singer to fill the role of Johnny Bravo."	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en
"""The Brady Bunch"" (1969) {Sorry, Right Number (#1.9)}"	 With Carol and the three girls added to the household, Carol convinces Mike to install a second telephone line into the home. One line into the den would be for Mike and Carol's exclusive use (and the kids only in emergencies), and the kids and Alice would use the telephone in the family room. The second telephone line makes matters worse as the kids constantly use the den telephone on what they deem emergencies, while someone else in the house is using the family room telephone. Even implementing rules for the family room telephone don't seem to solve the constant squabbling between the kids who are clamoring to use the telephone. The last straw for Mike is when he receives the astronomical telephone bill, and sees all the toll charges incurred. Taking a cue from Sam the butcher, Mike thinks he has the answer: exchange the family room telephone for a pay telephone. Although the extra money provided to each child to make telephone calls is more than their telephone bill, Mike believes it will teach the kids responsible use. But Mike doesn't foresee a certain business problem the pay telephone causes him. Six children, one telephone and an expensive phone bill prompt Mike to install a pay telephone in the home. The move was to teach the kids about responsible phone use, but it could end up costing Mike an important business deal with his company.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

However in 1940 it was Britain who was routed in Europe and,as the French had earlier lost morale,Churchill chose not to deploy air strikes on the continent,allowing for the decisive Battle of Britain. Like his ancestor Churchill saw the need for alliances,courting the support of President Roosevelt, to whom the first volume of biography was dedicated,even before America's official entry into the war. Now an accomplished strategist Churchill made the decision to engage on a Mediterranean war front,rather than back American plans for a premature invasion of northern France ,which turned the war in Allied favour. But,just as Europe endured an uneasy peace following Marlborough's last victory at Malplaquet, Churchill was aware that Russian domination of the East of the continent after the war threatened its liberty. Starkey concludes by endorsing Churchill's post-war policies and regretting the lack of a worthy successor to him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

The statues are actually a form of surveillance: the eyes of the crystals, relaying images from all over the countryside to Xax and Kreel. Two small children, Tilly and Flynn, are observed making fun of a statue and are dragged away to work in the Mines. The beautiful Lalia, who lost her fianc√© Brodam to Xax and believes him dead, also refuses to worship the idol and is taken prisoner - but is rescued by Will, who is very soon in love with her. However, Xax, watching through the crystals, has also become enamored of Lalia, and sets out himself in search of her. Will has discovered that the crystals used to transmit the images are from a particular, rare, highly flammable kind of quartz; they would need to be regularly replaces, so that if he could destroy the source - a single mine - the surveillance would cease. The jeweller Florian gives him ""star-silver"" - a substance that if fired into a seam of the quartz would act as a catalyst to blow up the entire mine. The band, with Lalia, set off for the mine with Xax on their hot trail. Will, posing as a Xaxian captain, manages to fool the Head Guard into evacuating the mine before he fires the star-silver into the crystal. Xax and the Warriors are frightened away by the news that the mine is about to explode. Tilly, Flynn and the other prisoners are safe; but the kind man who had taken care of them in captivity cannot be found. Will realizes that this man is none other than Brodam, and faces an almost unbearable choice: he either lets Brodam die, or loses Lalia forever. Nobly Will goes into the smoldering mine and save the life his rival. Will discovers that his challenge in this adventure was to learn to really love, and therefore act selflessly ...

"""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" (1959) {Beauty Is Only Kin Deep (#4.34)}"	 After knowing each other for one day, Dobie asks Nancy Sue to marry him, and she accepts. There's only one problem: coming from a traditional family, Nancy Sue can't get married until her older sister does, she who apparently is a Plain Jane of a woman. That older sister is none other than Dr. Imogene Burkhart. Despite Dr. Burkhart not knowing how to make herself a desirable woman, which she ultimately admits she wants to be, she already has a long term boyfriend - certified public accountant, the staid Clinton Hardwell - who just doesn't seem to notice that she really is a woman. Winnie is able to make Dr. Burkhart look more feminine, which doesn't work to make Clinton notice her as a woman. So they resort to Plan B: manufacture a make believe boyfriend for Dr. Burkhart to make Clinton jealous. The person they hire to play the make believe boyfriend is the Gillis' milk delivery man, Casimir H. Prohosky, Jr. But Plan B needs to be revised, more than once. What ultimately happens when the plan is executed is unplanned.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""The Missing Evidence"" (2014) {Nevada Triangle (#1.5)}"	 The Sierra Nevada has one of the most beautiful and dramatic landscapes in America. It is a land of extremes - from mountain peaks to scorching deserts - and the ultimate destination for thrill seekers. The Sierra Nevada is also a graveyard for over 2,000 crashed planes, including that of billionaire adventurer Steve Fossett. This is over 20 times more than the number believed to have been lost in the Bermuda Triangle. UFO expert Jeff Gonzales believes that the answer lies in the notorious Area 51. Rumours of captured alien technology have persisted since the Roswell incident in 1947. Gonzales believes that the testing of advanced alien technology is interfering with earthbound navigation systems. Aviation archaeologist Peter Merlin also thinks that Area 51 is responsible, but that the strange goings-on in the Sierra Nevada have nothing to do with alien technology. Standing over the wreckage of a military plane, he explains that Area 51 is a testing ground for advanced military aircraft - and prototypes are always more prone to accidents. That does not, however, explain the high number of civilian crashes. Researcher Kelly Redmond at the Desert Research Institute believes that the geology of the Sierra Nevada holds the key. The mountains rise to over 14,500 feet but plummet rapidly to the depths of Death Valley, 285 feet below sea level. Redmond believes that the contrast between such dramatic altitudes creates freak storms, but abnormal weather cannot explain the plane crashes that have occurred during perfect flying conditions. Zach Tolby at the National Weather Service in Reno believes that he has found the final piece of the jigsaw. He claims that the topography and weather conditions of the Sierra Nevada combine to create unpredictable downdrafts capable of causing aircraft to fall out of the sky.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Tic Tac Dough"" (1956)"	" The classic quiz show hosted by Win Elliot. In this game, the contestants are faced with a tic-tac-toe board with a different category in each square. To put their mark (X or O) in the square they want, they must first answer a question in the category listed there. For each question they answer correctly, they win a cash prize. The first contestant to put their mark in three squares in a row gets to keep the cash and move on to a bonus round for even bigger prizes. The first version of the classic game show, a general knowledge quizzer married to tic-tac-toe. Two contestants, including a returning champion competed (the champ was ""X,"" his challenger the ""O""). The host announced nine categories (a variety of pop culture and academic subjects); each player, in turn, selected a category and answered a question in that subject. A correct answer added $100 to the pot (or $200 if it were the center box, which had a two-part question tied to it); an incorrect answer left the box empty and available for his opponent. The first player to get tic-tac-toe was champion and faced a new challenger; there was no end game here, as in the later versions. Tie games were played if necessary, with the pot continuing to accumulate (sometimes well over $10,000) until claimed. ""Tic Tac Dough"" returned in 1978 to CBS and syndication, some 19 years after it was forced off the air in the wake of the Quiz Show Scandals."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Upstairs, Downstairs"" (1971) {Facing Fearful Odds (#4.12)}"	 Richard receives another visit from Mrs. Virginia Hamilton, the war widow he had met some months before. She again seeks his assistance but this time on a far more personal matter. Her 17 year-old son, an acting Sub-Lieutenant in the Navy, has been arrested and will face a court-martial charged with cowardice in the face of the enemy. He suggests that Virginia hire the family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon, to represent him and she quickly agrees. In the end, Richard can only but admire Virginia's strength of character and demeanor. Downstairs meanwhile, Ruby is taken to task for stealing food though she claims she has been using it to feed the animals at the zoo. With Edward away visiting his family, Hudson has also had to put up with Daisy's frequent and lengthy absences. The truth comes tumbling out when Hudson receives a visit from a military policeman to advise that Edward is absent without leave. It seems that Edward's regiment is to return to France and it's up to Hudson to try and knock some sense into Daisy and get her to convince Edward to return to his camp. Virginia Hamilton, who enlisted Richard's help as Civil Lord for a government scheme a year ago, has returned to the Eaton Place in behalf of her son, Michael. He is barely 18 years old and is facing a naval court martial for cowardice during a recent action. She is seeking legal advice and Sir Geoffrey Dillon agrees to represent Michael in the proceedings against him. Meanwhile, Edward has left to visit his family, but Hudson and Mrs. Bridges sense some odd behavior at Daisy's end. Moreover, Ruby is hoarding scraps of food and it doesn't go unnoticed -- not in these desperate times of extreme rationing. James is very disagreeable in his convalescence and resents that Hazel has accompanied Virginia to her son's trial in Dover. His behavior is extremely erratic and he is given to incoherent and very unsettling comments. In the end, Michael is found guilty of cowardice, but is spared expulsion, his extreme youth merits the consideration of the tribunal. Edward, however, is in serious trouble -- seems despite his indisposition, he's to be sent back to France and tried to dodge the authorities. Hudson tells Daisy that the ultimate punishment for Edward is the firing squad and Daisy discloses where he's hiding. Mrs. Bridges surmises that Ruby has been sending him the scraps of food she was storing. Despite a spirit that has galvanized all in the war effort, Daisy bitterly notes that a class-based double standard still exists. Michael Hamilton is found guilty with a slap on the wrist, but her husband, who is not at all well, can face dire consequences for being sent back to the fighting that has scarred him. Hudson protects Edward, but it's not a happy ending for Virginia Hamilton. Richard breaks the terrible news to her that Michael has been killed in the most recent action, perhaps to compensate for the recent verdict rendered against him. Virginia is devastated and Richard marvels at the dignity, character and extreme bravery of this exceptional woman -- a widow who has now sacrificed both her husband and teen-aged son for King and country.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

"""Whammy! The All New Press Your Luck"" (2002)"	" ""Whammy!"" was Game Show Network's true-to-the-original remake of the classic CBS game show, ""Press Your Luck,"" and served as a companion to reruns of the classic series, which GSN began rerunning in 2001. Three contestants competed in this three-round game. Each contestant was spotted $1,000 to start the game. The first round was the Bonus Board, where contestants faced an 18-space oval-shaped PYL board containing cash amounts, the names of prizes and Whammy spaces (the latter explained later). One at a time, the contestants stopped a randomly-flashing cursor by pressing their signaling device (and usually the scream ""STOP""). The contestant wins whatever appears in the lit space. He/she could then ""freeze"" with their winnings, or risk those winnings with increased odds they could hit a Whammy space (more such spaces were added as the contestant pressed his luck). If they hit a Whammy space, a humorous 3-D computer-animated sequence starring the Whammy, a hedgehog-like devil played and the contestant lost all their winnings up to that point. In both cases, control then passed to the next contestant. After all three contestants took their turn at the PYL board, the Question Round was played. Here, host Newton asked a toss-up question; the first to ring in provided his answer. That answer, plus two other possible answers were shown and the other two contestants given a chance to select from the three. A correct answer earned the first player three spins and the opponents one spin apiece; a wrong answer meant no spins for that player. Five such questions were played, with the players using their accumulated spins in the Final Bonus Board round. Like in the classic game, contestants could pass their earned spins to opponents (usually the highest scoring opponent to that point) if they feared landing on a Whammy; the opponent had to use those spins. At times, contestants could land on a double Whammy, in which case the contestant usually was on the receiving end of the Whammy's tricks (e.g., a pizza dough round landing on the contestant from above); it only counted as one Whammy. Any player landing on four whammies were eliminated from the game. The high scorer for the game was the winner and got to keep his/her winnings; other contestants ending with $0 and fewer than four whammies got a chance to return on a later show."	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en

When she explains how Hikaru is the more mischievous of the two, the twins react differently, dismantling their longstanding united front against the world to turn against each other in furious and violent squabbling."	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	en
